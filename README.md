Employees waste hours searching for content across wikis, drives, email, and apps.

Solution:
Build a production-grade Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) assistant that:

Connects to enterprise knowledge sources (Jira, Confluence, SharePoint, email)

Supports chat-style natural language Q&A

Provides citations, summaries, and task automation hooks

Includes role-based access, feedback loops, and LLM evaluation dashboards

⚙️ Use Case 1: "Autopilot PM Office" – Autonomous Program & PMO Assistant
🔍 Problem:
Too much time is wasted on repetitive PM admin work—agendas, updates, issues logs, RAID registers, etc.

🧠 Solution:
Build a LangChain-based RAG Agent integrated with your PM documents, project charters, SOWs, and meeting notes. This AI autonomously:

Drafts weekly status reports

Updates RAID logs and issue registers

Generates scope/charter/benefits docs

Prepares meeting agendas/minutes

Auto-formats project updates for CxO decks

🛠️ Stack:
LangChain + Watsonx.ai (for reasoning and language generation)

Google Calendar/Microsoft 365 APIs (for scheduling and meeting capture)

Notion or Confluence API (for syncing generated content)

Slack/Teams Bot Interface

🧪 Suggested Prompts:
“Summarize key risks from last 4 meetings and suggest 3 mitigations.”

“Generate a scope doc for a Salesforce CRM rollout using PRINCE2 templates.”

“Create a RACI matrix for the vendor onboarding process.”

“Build RAID log entries based on the latest project transcript.”

📊 Use Case 2: "Risk Whisperer" – AI Risk & Issue Analyzer
